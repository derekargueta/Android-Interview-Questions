Android-Interview-Questions
===========================
### Collaboration Rules
<p>Make sure your question is new and unique - not just rephrasing a previously existing question. If possible, include a link to the solution/topic. Questions should be fairly straightforward and completely technical (no "how many golf balls are in America" questions.) If there is a new topic that you think should be included, then include it!</p>
